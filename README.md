# AI Edition

> Examples of AI being impressive!

AI such as GitHub Copilot contribute greatly to a developer's work life but many of those moments are lost in time, only to live on in the good vibes.

This repository is just a small effort to record some of those moments.

The use-cases depicted by these moments are most likely undocumented officially (millions of possibilities), thus it might be useful for others to discover how AI can be used in programming.
